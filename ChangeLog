Changes from 0.3.0 to 0.3.1:

 * fix FS#10 - incomplete searchresults now complete
 * fixes FS#11 - do not use ob_* functions but a custom error handler to catch fopen errors
 * make password inputfield a password html-element to prevent shouldersurfing of password
 * make size of url input field as long as the value, but at least 40
 * remove stray write_log in myErrorHandler
 * make list_records return false instead of an empty result list if a search for an entry returned no results
 * use <href> tag for ID parsing instead of UID parameter in vCard
 * try harder to authenticate against server - especially useful for PHP 5.2.x
